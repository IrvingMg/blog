# Welcome to my blog!

## About me

My name is *Irving Mondrag√≥n* and I'm from Mexico. I am a Computer Engineer who
is passionate about designing and building new products, applying cutting-edge
technologies, for solving real-world problems.
Constantly searching for side projects to participate in which enable me to
learn new tech skills.

If you'd like to know more about my work, take a look to my website and GitHub profile:

## What's this for?

My blog works as a kind of notebook when I am learning a new technology but it
is also where I describe the processes that I follow to implement some of my
side projects. Therefore, posts you find here might cover a variety of subjects
on computer sciences.

Although this blog is intended to use English as first language, since I'm a
native Spanish speaker, you will find posts written in my mother tongue as well.
